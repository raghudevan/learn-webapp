# Intro - Making a web application
* If you're someone who's interested in getting started with making a web application but not quite sure where or how to start I'm hoping this project will make a good place to start!

# Pre-requisites, what to install and more!

## SCM(source code management) AKA versioning
* So you'll need something to version your code. [Git](https://github.com/raghudevan/learn-webapp/blob/master/docs/git/installation.md) is the best!


## Code editor of choice
* The code editor is essentially where all the magic happens, i prefer to use [SublimeText](https://github.com/raghudevan/learn-webapp/blob/master/docs/sublime-text/installation.md)


## Language of choice
* We're going to be using javascript extensively for both the front-end and the back-end
    - One language to rule them all
    - In my opinion, it's the easiest to pick up and build with
* The [MDN(Mozilla Developer Network)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is going to be our best friend in this entire process; it's got documentation to answer every question you will ever have about javascript


## NodeJS
* This software/tool will help us host our apps on a server. [NodeJS](https://github.com/raghudevan/learn-webapp/blob/master/docs/node/Installation.md) is basically a javascript runtime that can run outside a browser!
