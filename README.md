# Making a web application
* If you're someone who's interested in getting started with making a web application but not quite sure where or how to start I'm hoping to make this project a good place to start!

# Development setup
* In my opinion, this is the most crucial part of the development process. For without a good start, nothing else matters

## Code editor of choice
* The code editor is essentially where all the magic happens, i prefer to use [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
    - It free to use (i highly recommend buying a copy for yourself)
    - It is lightweight
    - It has got a log of plugin support

* Talking about plugins, the plugins listed below are the ones that I think are absolutely essential
    - side bar plugin (so that you can browse files and open them from the side bar)
    - babel plugin (javascript)

## Hot reloading
* We're going to setup something called hot-reloading wherein, as you make changes to your code, it'll reflect in the application in real-time

# Language of choice
* I'm going to be using javascript extensively for both the front-end and the back-end
    - One language to rule them all
    - In my opinion, it's the easiest to pick up and build with


# Packages? Whats a package?
* We're going to be using a a lot of third party software
    - any piece of code that we did not write ourselves
    - these are hosted on the internet with an open source license which allows us to use it and build things with it

* To get access to this code, We're going to be using a package manager to... well, manage our packages
    - `npm` [node package manager](https://www.npmjs.com/)


# NodeJS - [installation documentation](./documentation/Installation.md)
* To be able to use `npm` we're going to have to install `node`
    - when we transpile our code, it will in the context of `node`
    - when we make our backend services, they will run in the context of `node`
