# Installing Sublime Text
* Its pretty straight forward, just follow the steps [here](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)

## Reasons I choose SublimeText over the others

- It free to use (i highly recommend buying a copy for yourself)
- It is lightweight
- It has got a log of plugin support (cntrl + shift + p)

### Plugin Support
* The plugins listed below are the ones that I think are absolutely essential
    - SideBarEnhancements (so that you can browse files and open them from the side bar)
    - babel-sublime-master (helps with syntax highlighting)

* To install a plugin
    1. ctrl + shift + p
    2. type in "Package Control: Install Package"
    3. Search for the package and install
